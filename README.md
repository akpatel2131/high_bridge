- Session persistence using Firebase Auth

### Workflow Management
- Create, edit, and delete workflows
- Drag-and-drop workflow builder
- Node configuration panel with real-time updates
- Support for multiple node types:
  - API Call nodes
  - Email nodes
  - Text Message nodes
- Workflow execution and status tracking
- Workflow history and version control

### Dashboard
- List view of all workflows
- Search and filter functionality
- Pagination for better performance
- Expandable workflow details

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. Real-time Workflow Updates
**Challenge**: Maintaining consistency between the workflow builder and the database while handling multiple users.
**Solution**: 
- Implemented optimistic updates in the UI
- Used Firebase's real-time listeners for synchronization
- Added error handling and rollback mechanisms

### 2. Complex Node Configuration
**Challenge**: Managing different types of node configurations with varying fields and validation rules.
**Solution**:
- Created a modular node configuration system
- Implemented dynamic form fields based on node type
- Added validation rules specific to each node type

### 3. Performance Optimization
**Challenge**: Handling large workflows with many nodes and connections.
**Solution**:
- Implemented virtualization for node rendering
- Used React.memo and useCallback for performance optimization
- Implemented pagination and lazy loading for workflow lists

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness
**Challenge**: Creating a responsive design that works well on all device sizes.
**Solution**:
- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Implemented mobile-first design approach
- Created responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
- Added touch-friendly interactions for mobile devices

### 5. State Management
**Challenge**: Managing complex application state across multiple components.
**Solution**:
- Implemented Context API for global state
- Created separate contexts for authentication and workflow management
- Used custom hooks for reusable logic
